## 📢 News


- [2024/10.08]: 🔥 We release the HE-Drive paper on arXiv !

</br>

## 📜 Introduction

**HE-Drive** is a groundbreaking end-to-end autonomous driving system that prioritizes human-like driving characteristics, ensuring both temporal consistency and comfort in generated trajectories. By leveraging sparse perception for key 3D spatial representations, a DDPM-based motion planner for generating multi-modal trajectories, and a VLM-guided trajectory scorer for selecting the most comfortable option, HE-Drive sets a new standard in autonomous driving performance and efficiency. This innovative approach not only significantly reduces collision rates and improves computational speed compared to existing solutions but also delivers the most comfortable driving experience based on real-world data.

## 🛠️ Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Installation steps follow [SparseDrive](https://github.com/swc-17/SparseDrive)

### Set up a new virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n hedrive python=3.8 -y
conda activate hedrive
```

### Install dependency packpages
```bash
hedrive_path="path/to/hedrive"
cd ${hedrive_path}
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install torch==1.13.0+cu116 torchvision==0.14.0+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

### Compile the deformable_aggregation CUDA op
```bash
cd projects/mmdet3d_plugin/ops
python3 setup.py develop
cd ../../../
```

### Prepare the data
Download the [NuScenes dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#download) and CAN bus expansion, put CAN bus expansion in /path/to/nuscenes, create symbolic links.
```bash
cd ${hedrive_path}
mkdir data
ln -s path/to/nuscenes ./data/nuscenes
```

Pack the meta-information and labels of the dataset, and generate the required pkl files to data/infos. Note that we also generate map_annos in data_converter, with a roi_size of (30, 60) as default, if you want a different range, you can modify roi_size in tools/data_converter/nuscenes_converter.py.
```bash
sh scripts/create_data.sh
```

### Commence training and testing
```bash
# train
sh scripts/train.sh

# test
sh scripts/test.sh
```
