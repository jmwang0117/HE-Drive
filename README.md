## 📢 News


- [2024/10.08]: 🔥 We release the HE-Drive paper on arXiv.

</br>

## 📜 Introduction

**HE-Drive** is a groundbreaking end-to-end autonomous driving system that prioritizes human-like driving characteristics, ensuring both temporal consistency and comfort in generated trajectories. By leveraging sparse perception for key 3D spatial representations, a DDPM-based motion planner for generating multi-modal trajectories, and a VLM-guided trajectory scorer for selecting the most comfortable option, HE-Drive sets a new standard in autonomous driving performance and efficiency. This innovative approach not only significantly reduces collision rates and improves computational speed compared to existing solutions but also delivers the most comfortable driving experience based on real-world data.
